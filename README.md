# pycoMouse

This is an open source Micromouse project.

# Build Guide

Instructions for building the mouse are provided [here](BuildGuide.md). 3D printed parts files will be add soon. 

# Code

A library for controlling the mouse is provided in the code.py file. There are functions for moving forward, and turning left and right. As of now, the movements are not repeatable and the turns tend to go too far.
