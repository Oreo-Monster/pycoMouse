First we will soder the two boards, raspberry pi pico and BNO055, to our breadboard. Fit the pins through the boards, then push them onto the bread board. Make sure the long end of the pin
sticks all the way into the breadboard and the short end sticks through the top of the boards. There are plenty of resources on how to soder pins, we will link some here

_Add sodering video links_

Make sure to not do too many pins in one area at once, as the heat can damage the boards. When finished, ensure none of the pins are touching one and other.

Now we will shift to preparing teh  body of the mouse. Some extra holes need to be made for two extra sensors, the battery pakc, and the firont wheel. We will be using a meatle bolt that is the
same size as the rest of the bolt to make the holes. Using tweezers/plyers, hold the bolt in the position of the hole, and put the sodering iron on top with gentle pressure. After ~30 sec (soddering iron dependant)
the plastic shouild melt the the bolt can be gently pushed in. 

We will be adding two sensors sticking out the side of the body. These are mounted onto the middle post that hold teh front facing sensor. Position the sensors so their hole is somewhere over the middle support and makr the hole. Place the other sensors
in their poisition to make sure ther is no interference. Once the positions have been marked, we can use the hot bolt method to make out holes. The bolt does nto need to be pushed all the way though, just about the depth of the bolt used to hold the sensor, about half a centimeter. 
See the video and pictures below. 

_Making holes for sensors_


Position the battery pack as shown below. Ensure that there is room for teh front wheel rizer on the bottom as well. The battery pack should not overhang the back too much, as it may run into the motor controller which will hang off the back of the body.

Once  the battery pack is in the correct position, mark one of the inner two holes and use the hot bolt method to make a hole. It
